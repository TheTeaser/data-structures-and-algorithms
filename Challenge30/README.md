# Challenge Hash Table:
Implement a hash table.


## Approach & Efficiency
1. get_hash:
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```

2. add:
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```
3. get:
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```
4. contains:
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```
delete:
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```
