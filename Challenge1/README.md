# Challenge Title
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a function that takesan array and returns it reversed.
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
The user input the designated array,and the first function reverseArray() then it calls the other function (to reduce the complexity of O(N)) which is addLastElementToArray() and this function saves the last digit in the array and return it back to the first function, and thi cycle repeates until the whole array is processed. 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used the Single-responsibilty prenciple,witha Big O of O(N).

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
Just use the Pseudo code in Python, Give the target array value in Arr[] and call the reverseArray() function.
